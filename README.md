# Subgraph for Ethereum block data

This subgraph indexes all block data on the OONE Chain Devnet. 

Every block is handled by one mapping ```handleBlock```

##### Note 

The contract `ConverterRegistryContract` found in ABIs and subgraph.yaml is just a dummy contract used to pass formatting checks. Each block is handled automatically regardless of the logic in this contract.
